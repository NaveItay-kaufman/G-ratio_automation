# G-ratio automation
Computer Vision application of g-ratio measurement 

### Description
g-ratio parameter takes a cross section image of a nerve (obtained by Electron Microscopy) and measures the diameter of single fibers (axons) with and without the insulating layer (called Myelin). This ratio indicates the velocity in which electrical signals travel in the fibers and intern reflect on the properties and health of the nerve.

Currently, g-ratio quantification is done manually in Leah Amit lab, a task which is tedious and extremely time-consuming. Using Computer Vision, this software is able to detect the outline of the myelin layer and calculate the g-ratio automatically after setting a single threshold parameter for each image. This allows to collect data on a much larger scale in just a few minutes.
